##  Project Overview

This project explores satisfaction levels and career transitions into data roles across industries and global regions. The analysis was built using Power BI to uncover how factors like gender, income, experience, and education influence professional outcomes in tech.

##  Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power Query was used for extensive cleaning and transformation:

- Removed duplicates and null-heavy columns
- Standardized inconsistent inputs (e.g., “Y”, “Yes”, “YES” → Yes)
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Created derived columns:
  - Age Brackets
  - Income Tier
  - Experience Level
- Converted data types (Date, Decimal, Text)
